My name is Néstor Blanco and I'm 16 yo. 
I'm a solo begginer programer and sometimes game developer.

For the past year and a bit I've been learning different programming laguages and adquiring new skills on the subject; tech amazes me and I think it's the best thing I can work at

Now, in relation to coding, I'm still learning. I know basic Pyhton, as well as C#, HTML and CSS, although I'm currently working on these last ones.

I don't quite know where I want to be headed yet in terms of a job, so for now I'm just learning the basics.

My most recent project is a web page of my own, with HTML and CSS, where I explain a bit of who I am and what I do, as well as a bit of blogging.

If you want anything from me, feel free to let me know anywhere that you can, and I'll be happy to help!
