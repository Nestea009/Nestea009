# Hi I'm Nestea!
I'm a solo begginer programer and sometimes game developer.

For the past year and a bit I've been learning different programming laguages and adquiring new skills on the subject; tech amazes me and I want to be a programmer. 

I don't quite know where I want to be headed yet in terms of a job, so for now I'm just learning the basics.
