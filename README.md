# Hi I'm Néstor!
I'm a Spanish solo programer and sometimes game developer, I'm still learning and I'm open to suggestions!🔥

For the past  years I've been learning different programming laguages and adquiring new skills on the matter; tech amazes me and I want to be a programmer!

I don't quite know where I want to be headed yet in terms of a job, so for now I'm just learning the basics.

My biggest proyect so far is my personal website, click [here](https://nestea009.github.io) if you want to take a peek. 😋😋
